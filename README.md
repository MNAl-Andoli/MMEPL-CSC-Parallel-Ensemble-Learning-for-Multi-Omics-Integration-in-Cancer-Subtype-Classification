# MMEPL-CSC: A Hybrid Ensemble-Based Parallel Learning Framework for Multi-Omics Data Integration and Cancer Subtype Classification

## üî¨ Overview
MMEPL-CSC (Multimodal Ensemble Parallel Learning for Cancer Subtype Classification) is a deep learning and machine learning hybrid framework for multi-omics data integration and robust cancer subtype classification. The framework uses parallel processing, multimodal autoencoders, ensemble learning, and optimization via a hybrid Backpropagation‚ÄìParticle Swarm Optimization (PSO) strategy.

## üìÑ Abstract
Integrating multi-omics data to understand biological processes in human diseases is a complex bioinformatic task. Machine learning (ML), particularly deep learning (DL), offers a promising approach but is often limited by na√Øve data concatenation, single-model architectures, and inefficient optimization methods. 

This framework addresses these challenges by:
- Using multimodal autoencoders for feature extraction across different omics layers
- Combining multiple DL and ML models in a two-layer ensemble architecture
- Applying PSO for better optimization
- Executing all tasks in a parallelized environment to improve computational efficiency

Tested on TCGA Pan-cancer and TCGA BRCA datasets, MMEPL-CSC achieves 89.51% and 90.9% accuracy, respectively, and delivers speed-ups of 3x and 2.5x via parallel computing.
